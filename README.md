# SPOTIFY_CLONE_PROJECT

This is a Spotify Clone project built with HTML, CSS (using utility classes), and JavaScript to replicate the core design and layout of the Spotify web player. The project demonstrates responsive web design principles, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. This project focuses on showcasing front-end development skills through structured HTML, custom CSS utility classes, and interactive JavaScript functionality.

## Features

>> Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly between desktop and mobile devices.
>> Music Player UI: Includes play, pause, and next/previous track buttons (static, no real audio functionality).
>> Modern UI: Styled using CSS utility classes for rapid layout and design adjustments.
>> Custom Scrollbars: Styled scrollbars to match Spotifyâ€™s design.
>> Interactive Elements: Navbar, sidebar, and player interaction using JavaScript.
>> Dark Theme: Mimicking Spotify's dark-themed interface.

## Technologies Used
>> HTML5: Semantic structure of the web pages.
>> CSS3: Styling and layout using utility classes for reusable styling.
>> JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the page (navigation, player controls).
>> Responsive Web Design: Mobile-first approach with media queries.

## Custom CSS Utility Classes
Utility classes allow for rapid styling and easy layout changes. Some examples of utility classes used:

>> .flex: For applying Flexbox.
>> .centered: For centering content.
>> .text-white: For white text color.
>> .bg-dark: Dark background.
>> .p-10: Padding of 10px.
>> .m-0: Margin of 0.

## Responsive Design
This project follows mobile-first design principles, ensuring that it works flawlessly on small screens like mobile devices and scales up to larger screen sizes like tablets and desktops. Media queries are used to adjust the layout and styles based on the screen width.

## Responsive Design Demonstration
Desktop View: The layout features a fixed sidebar on the left, with a main content area showing the playlist and player at the bottom.
Mobile View: The sidebar is hidden, and a bottom navigation bar replaces it. The player is adjusted for a smaller view.

## JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript is responsible for adding interactive functionality such as:

>> Navbar toggle on mobile devices.
>> Play/pause controls for the media player.
>> Volume slider interaction.
